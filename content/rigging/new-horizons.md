I first got into rigging around 2010 with Maya and became relatively proficient with it during 2016-2019, but felt I hit a wall with what I could achieve with Maya's Dependency Graph. I saw many folks being able to do insane things with Maya C++ API, but around 2020-2023 I found my deep interests in general programming for pipeline, and got sidetracked.

Recently this space is getting excited again thanks to SideFX and Epic's new innovations with it, and I've been tinkering with both Unreal's ControlRig and Houdini's APEX rigging and I love their ideas!

This area is under construction, however. I hope to write up some decent articles with those new rigging contexts, especially how I utilize Unreal's ControlRig in my Fossil Skater game from the Unreal Fellowship (Games, Americas) 2024. Please come back later.
