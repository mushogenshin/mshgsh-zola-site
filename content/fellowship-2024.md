I was fortunate to be selected for [Unreal Fellowship 2024](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-fellowship-games-application-now-open). This year's is different as it's the first of its kind about games, and I'm super grateful to Epic Games for organizing this fantastic activity. I made many new friends, and the Fellowship opened a whole new world for me: firstly, as a creative person; secondly, as a Technical Art Director in the industry; and last but not least, as a solo developer in the community.

My Fossil Skater game -- a racing game where you ride dinosaurs who skate with car-shoes, diving into an erupting volcano to win -- is coming to Steam, Epic Games Store, and Itch, very soon -- tentatively this October 2024.
