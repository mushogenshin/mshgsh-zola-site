I've spent the better part of the last three months after Unreal Fest Seattle 2024 reading about a specific technology that I believe will significantly impact the future of game development if Epic Games can successfully implement it. I've written about why I'm convinced of this in an easy-to-understand way, using [humorous illustrations](https://childlike-verse-lang.web.app) to help explain my points. That technology is the Verse programming language. Although I know many of you may have heard of it since GDC 2023, coming from an artistic background, I feel that many people—especially those without programming experience—might miss the reasons why Verse is more than just another new language, and why learning it could be beneficial for game developers, whether they use Unreal Engine or not.

I submitted my essay as a speaker proposal for Unreal Fest Orlando 2025. If you think this would be interesting and helpful, please support me by reaching out to the Epic staff who approve speaker submissions.
