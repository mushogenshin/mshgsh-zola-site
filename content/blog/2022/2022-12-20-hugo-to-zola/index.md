So it took me five years to migrate my site from Wordpress to Hugo and to Zola.
During this period barely did I update anything, or give an explanation about why I stopped working on my "Battle of Cascina" (2014) and "Busts of Great Thinkers" (2016) projects.

What happened was that after being hired at Virtuos-SPARX* in 2018 as an "Anatomy Technical Art Lead", I started to dive deeper into Programming and picked up quite many other technical skills since then, e.g. Python, Rust, Vim, Docker, Unity, Unreal, Houdini, Flutter, etc., and in hindsight that was such my big break away from Art, probably because I deemed my journey with it was not as fruitful as I wanted it to be. But an exception to my moving away from Art, is that I managed to pick up Comparative Animal Anatomy by myself.

A lot of things in life also happened, for example, the 2019-2020 global pandemic and thus my still pending immigration petition to the USA, or other events of my Dad passing away, the cryptocurrency frenzy, the advent/threat of AI.

A month ago I moved to a new house that I rent and live with my girlfriend. We have been together since I came back to Vietnam in 2015, and she helped me a lot in my struggling years.

Now I've got a better physical home and a new website, it's time for a new start.

Thanks for passing by!
