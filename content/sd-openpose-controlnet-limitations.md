TODO: provide diagrams and examples to illustrate

- inspirations:
  - The Woke Salaryman
  - Pascal Campion
  - Etherington Brothers

TODO: prelude
The competition of crafted images with generated ones.

- Conflicts of the artists with technology and automation are not new:
  - music: synthetic music and synthesizers versus acoustic
  - painting: camera versus naked eyes
  - animation: interpolated versus hand-drawn

Specific problems for image-related artists in the face of automation: - entry level for laypeople to use - how directly applicable the technology can be to storytelling

- (Real) Limitations:
  - camera angle choices: favors more frontal posing, interesting foreshortenings are very rare
  - mundane poses are more prevalent: struggling to replicate sophisticated poses
  - rudimentary interaction among body parts
  - intrinsic flaw for torso representation: no control over spine curvature
