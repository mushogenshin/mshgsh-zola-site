You can find below a compilation of my small exercises/experiments with Unreal C++ while I study it, after I have been proficient in Python and Rust.

The tools gradually come out as a necessity when I have to provide [Unreal Control Rigs](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/profile/Truong+Cg+Artist) for the animation rigs of [Truong CG Artist](https://truongcgartist.gumroad.com/) **in batch**, which are mostly in Maya.

Therefore, in the example code, if you see `TRUONGCONTROLRIGS`, just know that's the name of my `.uproject`.

```cpp
UCLASS()
class TRUONGCONTROLRIGS_API UrAwesomeTools : public UAssetActionUtility
{
    --snip--
}
```

Enjoy the collection!
